Here's a template for your GitHub README file for the React Native project:

SMS Monitoring and Firebase Integration App
This React Native app monitors SMS messages on an Android device and sends specific data to Firebase Firestore for further processing. The app continuously polls for new SMS messages from a specific phone number, extracts relevant information, and updates the data in Firestore only when there's a change.

Features
SMS Monitoring: The app reads SMS messages from a specified phone number.
Firebase Firestore Integration: Data extracted from SMS messages is stored and updated in Firebase Firestore.
Data Change Detection: The app only updates Firestore when the new SMS data is different from the previous data.
Authentication: Firebase Authentication is used to ensure that only authenticated users can update the Firestore data.
Setup
Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your system.
React Native CLI: Install the React Native CLI globally.
Android Studio: Set up Android Studio with the necessary Android SDKs.
Firebase Project: Set up a Firebase project and obtain the google-services.json file.

Copy code
npm install
Set up Firebase:

Place the google-services.json file in the android/app directory.
Ensure your FirebaseConfig.js is correctly configured with your Firebase project credentials.
Run the app on Android:

bash
Copy code
npx react-native run-android
Building the APK
To generate a release APK:

Generate a Keystore (if you don't have one):

bash
Copy code
keytool -genkeypair -v -storetype PKCS12 -keystore my-release-key.keystore -alias my-key-alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
Place the my-release-key.keystore file in the android/app directory.

Configure Gradle:

Add the keystore information in android/app/build.gradle.
Build the APK:

bash
Copy code
cd android
./gradlew assembleRelease
Install the APK:

bash
Copy code
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
Usage
SMS Monitoring:

The app continuously monitors incoming SMS messages from a specific phone number.
Data such as "Dustbin Fill Level" and "Dustbin Location" are extracted and stored in Firestore.
Firestore Data Management:

The app only sends data to Firestore when the new SMS data differs from the previously stored data.
Configuration
Phone Number: Modify the phoneNumber variable in the App.js file to set the phone number from which SMS messages are monitored.
Polling Interval: Adjust the polling interval by modifying the setInterval function in the startPolling method.
